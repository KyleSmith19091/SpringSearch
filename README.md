An in-memory text search engine that is durable and persistent. Implementation based on ideas and structures from Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene. Uses
inverted indexes and term vectors to support full text search. Data and indexes are persisted on disk using a Write Ahead Log.

Springsearch is useful for searching Logs, metrics or even for developing a search backend.
